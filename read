🧠 Project: AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis with Hyperparameter Tuning
This project builds a binary classification model using Keras and Keras Tuner to predict whether a patient is healthy or at risk of disease based on features like age, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol.

🔍 Synthetic medical data is generated and normalized.

🧪 Hyperparameters (layers, dropout, learning rate) are tuned using Keras Tuner (RandomSearch).

🤖 The best model is trained and evaluated.

🩺 A real-time prediction is made for a new patient's medical data.

Perfect for learning model tuning, deep learning pipelines, and healthcare AI prototyping.
